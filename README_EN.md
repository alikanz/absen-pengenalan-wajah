so at the beginning we have to register the name that will be entered so that the data is stored and also will not be lost during the trial

- you have to fill in id & name
> for id we can fill in random or according to what is registered

- after that you press take a picture to take a sample of our picture
> so here our faces will be remembered by the system so that they can do attendance by taking samples from our faces

- after a while we take a new we press the save profile button
> so we will save the photo that has been taken with our name so the system knows who is in the photo

- after we did what is called data storage, now we just need to press the take a picture button, after that, the system will immediately save data from our name
> if asked for a password we have to set a password first 

thank you !!
